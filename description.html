<h1>Microservices and Service Meshes</h1>
<p>
This multi-product lab has you secure and manage the services of a microservice architected application using a service mesh.
Specifically, you will deploy and monitor your services in the mesh and visualize end-to-end traces of requests as they flow through each service.
In addition, you will apply custom routing and test the resiliency between those services in the mesh.
</p>
The lab is deployed on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and includes the following components:<br>
