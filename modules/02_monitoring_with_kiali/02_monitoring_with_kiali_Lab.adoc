= Service Mesh Monitoring with Kiali

At some point when you are developing your microservice architecture, you will
need to visualize what is happening in your service mesh. You will have
questions like “Which service is connected to which other service?” and “How
much traffic goes to each microservice?” But because of the loosely tied nature
of microservice architectures , these questions can be difficult to answer.

Those are the kinds of question that https://www.kiali.io/[Kiali] has the ability to answer, by giving
you a big picture of the mesh, and showing the whole flow of your requests and
data.

== How does Kiali work?

Kiali taps into the data provided by Istio and OpenShift to generate its
visualizations. It fetches ingress data (such as request tracing with Jaeger),
the listing and data of the services, health indexes, and so on.

Kiali runs as a service together with Istio, and does not require any changes
to Istio or Openshift configuration (besides the ones required to install
Istio).

== How to install Kiali?

. Set up environment variables for Jaeger and Grafana. This will be used by Kiali during the installation process. We'll talk more about Jaeger and Grafana in later labs.
+
----
export JAEGER_URL=http://$(oc get route tracing -n istio-system -o template --template='{{.spec.host}}’)

export GRAFANA_URL=http://$(oc get route grafana -n istio-system -o template --template='{{.spec.host}}')
----

. Install Kiali with the following commands:
+
----
# This command installs Kiali's configmaps
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/kiali/master/deploy/openshift/kiali-configmap.yaml | \
   VERSION_LABEL=master envsubst | oc create -n istio-system -f - --as=system:admin

# This command installs Kiali's secrets
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/kiali/master/deploy/openshift/kiali-secrets.yaml | \
   VERSION_LABEL=master envsubst | oc create -n istio-system -f - --as=system:admin

# And this command installs the Kiali service
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/kiali/master/deploy/openshift/kiali.yaml | \
   IMAGE_NAME=kiali/kiali \
   IMAGE_VERSION=latest \
   NAMESPACE=istio-system \
   VERSION_LABEL=master \
   VERBOSE_MODE=4 envsubst | oc create -n istio-system -f - --as=system:admin
----
+
NOTE: Installing Kiali may take a minute or two. 

. You can use the following commands to see if the service is running:
+
----
oc project istio-system
oc get pods -w
----

* Wait until the status for Kiali is `Running` and there are `1/1` pods in the
`Ready` column. 

+
----
TODO
----

. To exit, press `Ctrl+C`.

. View the routes for the project
+ 
----
oc get routes
----

* You'll see a result that's something like this:
+
----

. Enter this command to get the URL of the Kiali web console
+
----
export KIALI_URL=https://$(oc get route kiali -n istio-system -o template --template='{{.spec.host}}')

. Display the KIALI_URL
+
----
echo $KIALI_URL
----

. Start a web browser on your computer and enter the value for $KIALI_URL
+
image::images/kiali-login.png[]

. At the login screen, enter the default credentials: "admin/admin"

== Service Graph

After you login, you should see the Service Graph page:

image::images/kiali-service-graph.png[]

It shows a graph with all the microservices, connected by the requests going
through then. On this page, you can see how the services interact with each
other.

== Generating Sample Data

To show the capabilities of Kiali, you'll need an Istio-enabled application to
be running. For this, we can use our `gateway` application that we deployed
earlier.

. To generate data for it, we can use this command:
+
----
TODO
----

== Service Listing

. Move back to the Kiali web console

. Click the Services link in the left navigation. On the Services page you can
view a listing of all the services that are running in the cluster, and
additional information about them, such as health status.
+
image::images/kiali-service-list.png[]

. Click on the "Filter by Namespace" dropdown, and select "tutorial". Then,
you'll see a list of only the services on the tutorial:
+
image::images/kiali-service-list-2.png[]

. Click on the "TODO" to see its details:
+
image::images/kiali-service-details.png[]

. By hovering the icon on the Health section, you can see the health of a service
(a service is considered healthy) when it's online and responding to requests
without errors:
+
image::images/kiali-service-health.png[]

. You can also see the deployments:
+
image::images/kiali-deployments.png[]

. You can also the source services:
+
image::images/kiali-source-services.png[]

== Istio Config

The Istio configuration view allow you to browse and validate Istio configuration. The view also provides advanced filtering on navigation through Istio objects. Kiali provides inline config validation for networking objects such as VirtualServices and DestinationRules.

. Click the Istio Config link on the left navigation. On this page, you can see
all currently running config rules, such as Virtual Services, Route Rules,
Routes, Circuit Breakers, Fault Injection and so on.
